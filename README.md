### This is very much a work in progress. Some of these notes may be completely wrong.

### Findings so far:

* A received message is always prepended with one of: 
    * 0x01 0x00 
    * 0x02 0x00
    * 0x02 0x01
* Sent data is encapsulated with 0xFF 0x01 XX 0x00 ZZ
    * XX is the message length + 1 
    * ZZ is the message
* Received data is encapsulated with 0x01 0xFF XX 0x00 ZZ
    * XX is the message length + 1
    * ZZ is the message
* stop bluetooth communication: 0x2E 0x90 0x20 0x00
